# Our website
This is our website's code. If you know html and css, you'll be fine. All the PHP you see is just generating the html and css. 

## why CI/CD?

The last website experienced a "lost of history", many images drawn by former watercress artist, instant is gone. 
We weren't able to secure the protection of the all of the lost data. 
Eventually, we will make gallery, indepedent posts by various crew, etc however, we need some form of version control to preserve all that data.
we need some way to actually engineer and maintain the website regardless of who's in charge of it.


## what if I find a problem on the website?

Please make an Github issue, or make a trello task here: https://trello.com/b/t11Mrj8D/coding-department
The programming department is a busy department and sometimes looses track of things so make sure you make note of any big issues you find

## May I work on it?

Yes, any studio member can work on the website now. Before you do, make sure you:
* Have permission from the marketing department
* If you making a new large feature, following branch naming conventions, for example: */Coders/Lee/AvitusLayout*
